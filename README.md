# Sales Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

This interactive dashboard was developed during my Data Science Academy course to explore international sales performance. It uses filters, KPIs, and intuitive visuals to support smarter decision-making.

I enjoy working with raw data and transforming it into clear, useful insights. This project reflects my focus on clean design, structured modeling, and practical analytics.

## 🧠 What I Learned

During this project, I improved my skills in modeling and formatting data in Power BI. I worked with Unicode text files and organized tables to avoid errors. I created one-to-one and one-to-many relationships, ensured unique IDs, and kept the visuals consistent. I also used M language in Power Query to transform the data and strengthen the integrity between tables.

This project helped me consolidate key concepts in data modeling and preparation, while reinforcing my attention to detail and practical use of Power BI.
